### What Happens When You Run `go mod init`

Running `go mod init` initializes a Go module in your project and creates a `go.mod` file. The `go.mod` file manages dependencies and defines the module’s name and Go version.

### Key Points:

1. **Creates a `go.mod` File**:  
   The `go mod init <module-name>` command creates a `go.mod` file in your project directory, defining your module’s name and Go version.

2. **Isolated Modules**:  
   Each module has its own `go.mod` file and is isolated. For example:
    - **Project One**: `go mod init project-one`
    - **Project Two**: `go mod init project-two`

   The packages in `project-one/banana` and `project-two/banana` are separate and won't conflict unless you import them together in the same module.

3. **No Conflicts**:  
   If you don’t import `project-one` in `project-two`, or vice versa, there won’t be any conflicts. The `banana` package in each module remains independent.

4. **When Issues Arise**:  
   A conflict can occur if you try to import the same-named `banana` packages from both modules into one Go project. To avoid this, simply keep the imports separate.

### Conclusion
The `go mod init` command creates a self-contained Go module with its own dependencies. As long as you don't mix imports between modules, there will be no issues. Each module is isolated, and the `go.mod` file manages dependencies for you.
